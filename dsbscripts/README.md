This subdirectory contains the Dsb scripts for executing
some typical developer commands in containers.

You can add this subdirectory to the host system PATH variable
or copy some of these scripts to your local bin directory,
which is already included into the PATH variable.
In the latter case, you can rename the scripts if necessary.
